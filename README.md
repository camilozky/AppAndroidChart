This is an Android Studio project written in Kotlin that demonstrates how to plot the sine and cosine functions using MPAndroidChart library. The project allows you to plot the sine and cosine functions with different colors on a graph.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

Android Studio 4.0 or higher
Kotlin 1.4.20 or higher
MPAndroidChart library version 3.1.0 or higher
### Installing
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Sync the Gradle files and install any missing dependencies.
Run the project on an emulator or a physical device.
### Usage

The project consists of a single activity that displays a graph with the sine and cosine functions plotted on it. The graph is displayed using the MPAndroidChart library. The user can change the color of the sine and cosine functions by selecting a different color from a color picker.

### Code Structure

The project follows a clean architecture approach, with a clear separation of concerns between different layers. The project has the following package structure:

data: This package contains the data layer of the application. It consists of classes that are responsible for retrieving data from a remote data source or a local database.
domain: This package contains the business logic of the application. It consists of classes that define the use cases of the application.
presentation: This package contains the presentation layer of the application. It consists of classes that are responsible for displaying the data to the user and handling user input.
utils: This package contains utility classes that are used throughout the application.
